Benchmark Email Lite creates a newsletter sign-up form widget.

== Description ==

Benchmark Email Lite creates a newsletter sign-up form widget. The widget creates a simple W3C and WAVE validated sign-up form to instantly subscribe visitors to a Benchmark Email contact list, requesting the subscriber's first name, last name, and email address. If the subscribe pre-exists on the list, this will update the subscriber's first and last names on the mailing list.

The sign-up form uses standard HTML list items so it can be manipulated by CSS within your theme to match your site's design. Some themes will automatically style the widget to match the design. Contact us or the designer of your theme if you are having difficulties getting the form to match your theme, or add your own child theme with CSS that styles the elements accordingly.

Clicking the affiliate link will, if you eventually sign-up for a paid account with Benchmark Email, earn us a commission that we can use to support this plugin and develop it further.

The widget can be placed in any widget compatible area of your theme. It contains administrative controls where you enter an optional title, your Benchmark Email API token, and the name of the list for your visitors to be subscribed to. There is an optional setting to limit the plugin to a single page, if desired.

The widget can be extended to allow subscriptions to multiple lists or even multiple Benchmark Email API accounts. This is accomplished by installing multiple instances of the widget in various widget compatible areas of your theme. You may use a third party plugin to control which pages or posts the widget appears on. There are several plugins available for doing that, including the following:
